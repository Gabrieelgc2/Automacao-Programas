# Windows Setup Automation with Python

This project is a **complete Windows setup automation**, developed in Python.  
Its main goal is to **automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks** usually performed manually after installing Windows.

The script combines **PowerShell, Chocolatey, and GUI automation** to install essential software, remove unnecessary applications, and execute administrative commands in a standardized way.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created to:

- Automate new computer setups
- Reduce manual installation time
- Standardize Windows environments
- Demonstrate system automation using Python
- Serve as a base for personal or enterprise setup tools

---

## ⚙️ How the Project Works

The automation follows a clear step-by-step flow:

1. Administrator permission verification
2. PowerShell command execution
3. Automatic software installation
4. Removal of Windows built-in applications
5. GUI automation when required
6. Packaging the script into an executable (.exe)

---

## 🔐 Administrator Privileges

At startup, the script checks if it is running with **Administrator privileges**.  
If not, execution is stopped, since many operations require elevated access, such as:

- Software installation
- PowerShell command execution
- Windows app removal

---

## 🧩 PowerShell Usage

The project uses **PowerShell** to execute system-level commands, including:

- Installing **Chocolatey**
- Running administrative scripts
- Managing software packages
- Removing Windows built-in apps (bloatware)

PowerShell commands are executed through Python using modules like `subprocess`, ensuring full automation and control.

---

## 📦 Chocolatey – Package Manager

After the initial checks, the script automatically installs **Chocolatey**, a package manager for Windows.

With Chocolatey, the project installs essential software silently, such as:

- Google Chrome
- Adobe Reader
- WinRAR

This removes the need for manual downloads and installation steps.

---

## 🧹 Windows Bloatware Removal

The script removes unnecessary default Windows applications using PowerShell commands.

This helps to:

- Improve system performance
- Reduce resource usage
- Keep the environment clean and professional

---

## 🖱️ GUI Automation with PyAutoGUI

For scenarios where terminal-based automation is not enough, the project uses **PyAutoGUI** to:

- Simulate mouse clicks
- Send keyboard inputs
- Interact with windows and menus
- Locate on-screen elements using image recognition (.png files)

The images included in the project are used as visual references during automation.

---

## 🧪 Executable (.exe) Generation

The project is packaged using **PyInstaller**, generating a standalone executable (`.exe`).

This allows:

- Running the project without Python installed
- Using it on any Windows machine
- Easy distribution of the automation tool

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Windows-only project
- Must be run as **Administrator**
- Some automations depend on screen resolution and system language
- Review and adapt the code before production use
